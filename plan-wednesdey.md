Wednesday
=========

Gregor plans to be at school at 6:00pm

During that time I will be working with anyone that is there to teach about programming. 
This session is for beginners and those that like to get a refresher in programming.
  
We will discuss the following:
  
Part I: Variables and Files
---------------------------

* [ ] how to use variables
* [ ] how to use files
* [ ] how to use files and variables
  
Part II: Going Straight
----------------------

* [ ] Math: How to get the distance from a wheel wher we know circumferance and diameter

  * [ ] How to measure the diameter of a wheel 
  * [ ] How to measure the circumference of a wheel with a string
  * [ ] How to read the diameter od a whele from the lego tires
  
* [ ] Math: C/d = pi
  
  * [ ] Experiment 1: We will measure the circumferenace and diameter and calculate C/d
  * [ ] Experiment 2: We will compare the different ratios for the different wheel sizes
  * [ ] Experiment 3: We will recalculate the distance by C/pi = d
  * [ ] Review: We will be watching https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference
  
* [ ] Basic program
 
  *  [ ] Organizing programs
  
    * [ ] Naming: 
    
      * [ ] variable names lower case  
      * [ ] program names: __pForward__
      * [ ] test programs: __tForward__ (copy __pForward__)
      * [ ] __IMPORTANT__: myBlocks: __mForward__ (only use __tForward__ if something is wrong with myblock, delete __tforward__ and start from __pForward__)
      
        * Reasoning: if you make a definition error in myBlocks they can not be reversed, and you have to start over. For big programs this is a problem. Afoid that you spend hours of recreating the big program.

  * [ ] Write a basic program using the above while using the variables __distance__, __speed__, __circumferance__
  * [ ] Write a __myBlock__ that has the following inputs inputs __distance__, __speed__, __circumferance__. Set proper default sfor the vakues. distance = 10cm, speed=40, circumference = the one you found for your wheel in the math section
  
    * We write such a program abbreviated as __mForward(distance, speed, circumferenace)__
 
  * [ ] Test your robot with the new program
  
* [ ] Creating a Library for moving

  * [ ] __mForward(distance, speed, circumferenace)__
  * [ ] __mTurnLeft, mTurnRight(distance, speed, circumferenace)__
  * [ ] __mTurnLeft45, mTurnRight45(distance, speed, circumferenace)__
  * [ ] __mTurnLeft30, mTUrnRigt(distance, speed, circumferenace)__
