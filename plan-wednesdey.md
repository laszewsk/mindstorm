Wednesday
=========

Gregor plans to be at school at 6:00pm

During that time I will be working with anyone that is there to teach about programming. 
This session is for beginners and those that like to get a refresher in programming.
  
We will discuss the following:
  
Part I: Variables and Files
---------------------------

* [ ] how to use variables
* [ ] how to use files
* [ ] how to use files and variables
  
PartII: Going Straight
----------------------

* [ ] Math: How to get the distance from a wheel wher we know circumferance and diameter

  * [ ] How to measure the diameter of a wheel 
  * [ ] How to measure the circumference of a wheel with a string
  * [ ] How to read the diameter od a whele from the lego tires
  

* [ ] Math: C/d = pi
  
        * [] Experiment 1: We will measure the circumferenace and diameter and calculate C/d

        * [] Experiment 2: We will compare the different ratios for the different wheel sizes
        
        * [] Experiment 3: We will recalculate the distance by C/pi = d
        
        * [ ] Review: We will be watching https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference
        
* [ ] Basic program
 
  * Write a basic program useing the above while using the variables __distance__, __pi__, __circumferance__
